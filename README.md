This is a Rails app for testing some features I'm working on.

I started from the blog tutorial in [RailsGuides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and added a few more features including:
*   A fancy UI with Twitter Bootstrap
*   Automatic versioning with a diff interface between versions
*   A text editor for `textarea` form fields witha a custom jquery toggle switch back to source view
